# Windwaker-Saves
A collection of save files for TLOZWW, for use with dolphin.


Either import these into an MemoryCardA.USA.raw file via Dolphin's Memory Card Management, or if you are using GCI Folder
as your memory card simply name the save you want `01-GZLE-gczelda.gci` and place it in the `UserGlobalDirectory/GC/USA/Card A/` directory
